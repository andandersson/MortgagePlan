This is an application for creating a mortgage plan. Customers for
a bank want to borrow money, for a certain amount of years, and
pay off their debt with a certain interest rate. The application is calculating
their monthly payment according to this formula:
E = U[b(1 + b)^p]/[(1 + b)^p - 1],
where:

E = Fixed monthly payment
b = Interest on a monthly basis 
U = Total loan
p = Number of payments

The project is build, run and tested with Gradle.
It is started from the MainApp.class
